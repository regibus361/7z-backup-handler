The list of items (directories / files) to archive, and the directory to store archives, are stored in a source file (delimited by newlines) and destination file respectively.
You will need to set the paths to these files in the source.

The program console awaits user input at various points. If you wish to run the program without user interaction (e.g. as an automated task), pass the first command line argument "IsScheduledTask", which will bypass this.

This should require the .NET framework (5.0) to run.
